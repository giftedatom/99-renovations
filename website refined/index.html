## **Option 3: I'll create a proper index.html for you**

Would you like me to:
1. Recreate the home page as `index.html` instead?
2. Just give you a simple redirect file?

## **GitHub Pages Setup:**

Make sure your repository structure looks like:
```
your-repo/
├── index.html (or home.html renamed)
├── about.html
├── kitchens.html
├── meet-our-team.html
├── survey.html
├── Get-a-quote.html
├── logo_transparent_background.png
├── bathroom_image1.jpg
├── bathroom_image2.jpg
└── (all other images)
